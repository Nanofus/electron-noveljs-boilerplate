# electron-noveljs-boilerplate

A simple boilerplate for [Novel.js](http://github.com/Nanofus/novel.js) using [Electron](https://github.com/atom/electron). Electron allows you to create standalone desktop games with Novel.js for Windows, OSX and Linux.

## Usage

1. `npm install` to install Novel.js, Vue.js and Electron.
2. Run Electron by executing the `electron.exe` file in `node_modules/electron-prebuilt/dist/`.
3. Drag `app/main.js` in to the Electron window to test the game.

The game files are in `app/game/`, and the main view in `app/index.html`. See [Novel.js documentation](https://github.com/Nanofus/novel.js/blob/master/DOCUMENTATION.md) to learn how to use them.

To learn more about Electron, see its [documentation](https://github.com/atom/electron). To package a finished game, see [Application Distribution](https://github.com/atom/electron/blob/master/docs/tutorial/application-distribution.md) in the Electron docs.
